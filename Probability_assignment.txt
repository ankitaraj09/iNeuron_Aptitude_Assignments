1. The probability that both cards are queens or diamonds can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of drawing two queens and the probabilities of drawing two diamonds, minus the probability of drawing two cards that are both queens and diamonds:
   Probability = (4/52) * (3/51) + (13/52) * (12/51) - (4/52) * (3/51)
   Simplifying the expression gives: Probability = 13/221
   Answer: Option a. 20/221

2. The probability that 5 balls drawn are pink and the rest are orange can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of drawing 5 pink balls and 3 orange balls (since a total of 8 balls are drawn):
   Probability = (6/14) * (5/13) * (4/12) * (3/11) * (2/10) * (8/9) * (7/8) * (6/7)
   Simplifying the expression gives: Probability = 16/143
   Answer: Option a. 16/143

3. The probability that the room gets lighted can be calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 4 good bulbs) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing 4 bulbs from a dozen):
   Probability = (6C4) / (12C4) = 15/66
   Answer: Option c. 33/44

4. The probability that at least one letter is placed in the wrong addressed envelope can be calculated as the complement of the probability that all letters are placed correctly:
   Probability = 1 - (1/10!)
   Answer: Option c. 1 - (1/10!)

5. To find the probability that the product of three randomly selected numbers from 1 to 10 is an odd number, we need to consider the possible combinations of odd and even numbers:
   Odd * Odd * Odd = Odd
   Even * Even * Odd = Even
   Even * Odd * Odd = Even
   Odd * Even * Odd = Even
   Odd * Odd * Even = Even
   Therefore, the probability is 1/2.
   Answer: Option b. 1/2

6. The probability that either both shirts are white or blue can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of picking two white shirts and the probabilities of picking two blue shirts:
   Probability = (2/15) * (1/14) + (3/15) * (2/14) = 1/105
   Answer: Option a. 1/105

7. The probability of picking up 2 orange towels randomly can be calculated as the ratio of the number of orange towels to the total number of towels:
   Probability = (6/15) * (5/14) = 2/7
   Answer: Option c. 2/7

8. The probability that the first ball drawn is "red" and the second ball is "green" can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of drawing a red ball first (10/26) and a green ball second (16/25):
   Probability = (10/26) * (16/25) = 8/39
   Answer: None of the provided options.

9. The probability of drawing a face card (Jack, Queen, or King) can be calculated as the ratio of the number of face cards (12) to the total number of cards (52):
   Probability = 12/52 = 3/13
   Answer: Option A. 3/13

10. To calculate the number of questions wrongly answered by X, we can subtract the number of correct answers (141/4) from the total number of questions attempted (94):
   Number of questions wrongly answered = 94 - (141/4) = 47
   Answer: Option B. 47

11. The probability of selecting 2 women when 4 persons are chosen at random from a group of 3 men, 2 women, and 4 children can be calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 2 women) to the total number of possible outcomes (selecting 4 persons):
   Probability = (2C2) / (9C4) = 1/9
   Answer: Option D. 1/9

12. The probability that a card drawn is either a heart card or a diamond card can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of drawing a heart card and the probabilities of drawing a diamond card, minus the probability of drawing both a heart card and a diamond card:
   Probability = (13/52) + (13/52) - (1/52) = 3/4
   Answer: Option B. 3/4

13. The probability of neither getting an even number on one die nor a multiple of 3 on the other can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each die not rolling an even number or a multiple of 3:
   Probability = (3

/6) * (4/6) = 1/3
   Answer: Option D. 1/6

14. Two events K and L are disjoint if they have no common outcomes. In this case, if P(K) = 0.8 and P(L) = 0.6, they can be disjoint only if their intersection, P(K âˆ© L), is equal to zero. We don't have information about the intersection, so we cannot determine if these two events are disjoint or not.
   Answer: Option B. False

15. The probability that the ticket drawn has a number which is a multiple of 4 or 15 can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of drawing a ticket with a number divisible by 4 and the probabilities of drawing a ticket with a number divisible by 15, minus the probability of drawing a ticket with a number divisible by both 4 and 15 (multiple of 60):
   Probability = (5/20) + (1/20) - (1/20) = 6/19
   Answer: Option A. 6/19

Please note that for question 14, we cannot determine if the events are disjoint without additional information.
