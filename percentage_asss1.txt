Solution: (2,4)

2: Equations 2X+3Y=9 & 7X+9Y=-6 have how many solutions?

Using elimination method:

Multiplying the first equation by 3, and the second equation by -1.5, we get:

6X + 9Y = 27
-10.5X - 13.5Y = 9

Adding the two equations together, we get:

-4.5X - 4.5Y = 36

Dividing both sides by -4.5, we get:

X + Y = -8

Now we can use this result to solve for one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute it into 
one of the original equations to solve for the other variable. For example, if we solve for Y in terms of X, we get:

Y = -X - 8

Substituting this expression for Y into the first equation, we get:

2X + 3(-X - 8) = 9

Simplifying and solving for X, we get:

-X - 21 = 0
X = -21

Substituting this value of X into the equation Y = -X - 8, we get:

Y = -(-21) - 8 = 13

So the solution to the system of equations is (X,Y) = (-21, 13).

3. Equation 7x+9y=-5 has how many keys?


Rearranging the equation, we get:

7x + 9y = -5
7x = -9y - 5
x = (-9/7)y - 5/7

Now, if we pick any value for y, we can plug it into this equation to get a corresponding value for x. For example, if we set y = 0, we get:

x = (-9/7)(0) - 5/7
x = -5/7

So one solution to the equation is (x,y) = (-5/7, 0).

Similarly, if we set y = 1, we get:

x = (-9/7)(1) - 5/7
x = -14/7 = -2

So another solution to the equation is (x,y) = (-2, 1).

4. Equation ax^2+bx+c=0 will be ............. for a=b=c=0 .


The equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is a quadratic equation in the variable x.

If a = b = c = 0, then we have:

0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0

This equation simplifies to:

0 = 0

This is not a quadratic equation, since the highest power of x is 0, not 2. It is a trivial equation, and it is true for all values of x.

In summary, the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a = b = c = 0 is not a quadratic equation, and it is a trivial equation that is true for all values of x.

5. Income of A & B is in ratio 2:3. For example, if Bâ€™s income is Rs 3000, find out the ratio of their expenditures if their savings are Rs 500 & Rs 700,
respectively.

Let A's income be 2x and B's income be 3x. If B's income is Rs 3000, then we have:

3x = 3000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1000

So A's income is 2x = 2000.

Now, we can find the ratio of their expenditures. Let A's expenditure be E1, and B's expenditure be E2. 
We know that their savings are Rs 500 and Rs 700, respectively. So we have:

E1 = (2/5)(2000) - 500 = 300
E2 = (2/5)(3000) - 700 = 400

Therefore, the ratio of their expenditures is:

E1 : E2 = 300 : 400 = 3 : 4

Note that we used the fact that their incomes are in the ratio 2 : 3 to find the fraction of their incomes that they spend, 
which is (2/5) for both A and B (since they save 500 and 700, respectively). We then multiplied these fractions by their incomes
 to find their respective expenditures.
